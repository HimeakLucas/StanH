## Abstract
In end-to-end learned image compression, encoder
and decoder are jointly trained to minimize a R + λD cost
function, where λ controls the trade-off between rate of the
quantized latent representation and image quality. Unfortunately,
a distinct encoder-decoder pair with millions of parameters must
be trained for each λ, hence the need to switch encoders and
to store multiple encoders and decoders on the user device for
every target rate. This paper proposes to exploit a differentiable
quantizer designed around a parametric sum of hyperbolic
tangents, called STanH , that relaxes the step-wise quantization
function. STanH is implemented as a differentiable activation
layer with learnable quantization parameters that can be plugged
into a pre-trained fixed rate model and refined to achieve different
target bitrates. Experimental results show that our method
enables variable rate coding with comparable efficiency to the
state-of-the-art, yet with significant savings in terms of ease of
deployment, training time, and storage costs.

## Preparation 
In order to use this code, You can create a conda environment, with CUDA if you use GPU (suggested)

```
conda create -n $NAME python=3.8
conda activate $NAME

conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Validate

Download our pretrained model (based on Zou2022) in the following directory from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJ6nmQZJyMaJKFzr-sb2C9m9oxHE5pE5).



```
cd src 

python demo.py \
--image_path #path-for-the-image-to-encode \ 
--model_checkpoint #path-for-the-checkpoint-of-the-anchor \
--stanh_path #path-where-stanhs-are-saved \ 
--wandb_log #if-ypu-want-wandb-plot \ 
--entropy_estimation #estimation-of-entropy (faster) 
--path_save #path-where-to-save-results \
--interpolation #to include-interpolated-points
--device cuda
```

Until now, we use Torcach to perform Arithmetic coding (very slow), in future code will be adapted to use RANS as standard model in CompressAI library

## PIBIC fork — STanH as a domain-adaptation adapter

This is a research fork (undergraduate research / PIBIC). The goal is to test whether the
STanH quantization layer also works as a **lightweight fine-tuning adapter** for
domain-specific datasets (X-ray, faces, documents): the anchor backbone (Zou22/WACNN)
released by the authors is **frozen**, and only the STanH parameters (`w`, `b`) are
refined on the target domain, then compared against the generic derivations and against
the VVC reference software (VTM), following the paper's evaluation protocol.

### Running

All scripts expect to be run **from the repository root** with `src` on the path:

```bash
conda activate stanh
export PYTHONPATH=src            # scripts also resolve ../src automatically

python eval/evaluate_kodak.py    # STanH RD curve on Kodak
python eval/eval_vtm.py          # VTM baseline on Kodak (needs VVCSoftware_VTM built)
bash   train/run_xray_finetune.sh
python plots/plot_final.py
```

Datasets live under `datasets/` and model checkpoints under `models/` (both git-ignored,
except the tiny paper derivations). The 300 MB anchor must be downloaded from the
authors' [Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJ6nmQZJyMaJKFzr-sb2C9m9oxHE5pE5)
into `models/original_paper/STanH/anchor/`.
